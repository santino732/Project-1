package FishMarketProgram;

/*1. Write a program called FishMarket: (This means public class FishMarket)
*2. Write a new class called Seafood. (Seafood is a superclass.)
*    Seafood can be either a Fish Shrimp Scallop or Crab. (Use Inheritance)
*    They have weight and price per lb.
*3. Write a method to construct Seafood at random in FM.java. (We want 300 seafoods)
*   Your random seafood generator, generates one of those seafood types at random
*  giving it a random weight (lbs).  The price per lb stays same within each of the typings.
*4. Use a buffered writer (or scanner) to Export out your data as a .csv file.
*    The header should be:index, type, weight, price.Index in this case is which entry we are on.
*    Also note that your fields should be separated by commas.
*5. Open Excel and graph the weight.  Make a second graph the count of types. (Histogram)
*6. Add weights to your seafood generator so that more fish is caught, and less scallop and crabs.
*    This means, assigning some "weight" value in your if/else if block to increase the chances that more fish is caught.
*    Allow the weights to be configurable.  (Make them user input via method parameter and or global variable.
*    Repeat the histogram of types again.
*7. Write a method that loads the csv and populates an array of all of the seafood.
*8. Write a toString that will print out all the seafood you just loaded. (DONT LOAD IN toString)
*Conventions:  Don't write entire program in main method.  Write helper methods as needed.  Main method should be 10 lines max.
